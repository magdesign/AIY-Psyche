run with python3

## TO DO

1.
Currently if welcome is triggered, this triggers "welcome.mp4" (line 100).

New: 
this should trigger one of the movies in "../media/welcome/"  if only one video is in this folder, use this. Otherwise use a random one of them. So its not always the same welcome speech.


2.
Currently after one of the joy scores is detected (line 106), it plays "average.mp4", "happy.mp4" or "sad.mp4"

New: 
if the avg_joy_score is "average", rondomly select and play one of the movies in "../media/average/"
if the avg_joy_score is "sad", rondomly select and play one of the movies in "../media/sad/"
if the avg_joy_score is "happy", rondomly select and play one of the movies in "../media/happy/"


Thanks for your work!
